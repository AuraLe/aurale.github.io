        <h2>Red Velvet Cupcakes</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>This recipe will yield about 24 cupcakes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 cups cake flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa (not Dutch process)</li>
            <li>1  teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>4 Tablespoons liquid red food coloring</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons vanilla</li>
            <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350*F.  Prepare cupcake pan with liners, or butter and flour cake pans and line bottoms with parchment.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl whisk cake flour, cocoa and salt, and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer (fitted with the whisk attachment), beat oil and sugar until well blended.  Add eggs one at a time, and continue beating.  Add food coloring and vanilla and mix well.</li>
            <li>Add flour and buttermilk alternately, in two batches.  Scrap down the sides of the bowl as needed.  Mix just enough to combine.</li>
            <li>Place baking soda in a bowl or cup, add vinegar and stir (it will foam and expand).  Add to cake batter and beat for 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Fill cupcake liners 2/3-3/4 full, or divide batter between cake pans.  Bake cupcakes 20-24 minutes.  Bake cake layers 25-40 minutes depending on the size of the pans.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup (1 stick/8 Tablespoons) butter (set at room temp about 10 minutes, but should still be cool)</li>
            <li>8 oz. cream cheese (directly from fridge)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (always use pure vanilla extract if possible)</li>
            <li>4 cups powdered confectioners sugar</li>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place butter in a large mixing bowl and beat until smooth. Add cream cheese and blend until fully combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add vanilla extract and powdered sugar (one cup at a time) while mixing.  Increase to medium speed and beat until it begins to get fluffy.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the heavy cream, a little bit at a time until desired consistency is met. (Don’t add too much if you want the frosting to stay in place when piped on cupcakes.)</li>
            <li>Beat until fluffy, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Frost cupcakes.</li>
        </ol>
